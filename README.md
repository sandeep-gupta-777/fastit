# Trillion_FE

This is the frontend part of the ICICI digital landing project.
This project is made with angular5 and bootstrap 4. It also utilizes SCSS CSS preprocessor. 
In future, I am planning replace js part of bootstrap 4 with ng-bootstrap to reduce jquery and popper.js dependecies.

## Running on local machine
1. Clone the project
2. run npm install
3. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
