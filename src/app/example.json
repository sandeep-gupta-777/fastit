It is a system that takes popular posts from reddit, reposts them on 9gag and adds fake upvotes. &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/9gag/comments/3m93jh/the_current_state_of_9gag/\"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"/u/FroggierSnow7\"&gt;/u/FroggierSnow7&lt;/a&gt; explains it (OUTDATED). This used to be a manual process (more about the old system can be read &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/9gag/comments/zabeb/9gag_repost_machine_explained/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but it is currently automated.
